EdgeUsher is a simple, yet general, probabilistic declarative methodology and a (heuristic) backtracking strategy to model and solve the _VNF placement problem_ in Cloud-Edge computing scenarios. EdgeUsher has been prototyped by means of the probabilistic logic programming language [ProbLog](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/index.html). 

It inputs:

- a description of one (or more) VNF chain(s) along with its (their) hardware, IoT, minimum bandwidth, maximum end-to-end latency and security requirements, and 
- a (probabilistic) description of the corresponding (hardware, IoT, bandwidth, latency and security) capabilities offered by the available Cloud/Edge infrastructure.

Based on those, EdgeUsher outputs a ranking of all eligible placements for the VNF chains and routing paths for the related traffic flows over the available Edge-Cloud infrastructure. The ranking considers how well a certain placement can satisfy the chain requirements as the infrastructure state (probabilistically) varies.

EdgeUsher methodology is described in the following technical report:

In the following, we briefly present the model used by EdgeUsher and how it is possible to use it.

### Model

#### VNF Chains

EdgeUsher permits to easily specify chains of virtual network service functions and their hardware, IoT, network QoS and security requirements. Indeed, a VNF chain -- identified by a  ```ChainID``` and composed of a list of ```ServiceFunctionIDs``` -- can be declared as

```prolog
chain(ChainID, ServiceFunctionIDs).
```

The requirements of each service function ```F``` composing the chain can be declared as in

```prolog
service(F, TProc, HWReqs, IoTReqs, SecReqs).
```

where ```TProc``` is the average processing time (expressed in ms) of ```F```, ```HWReqs``` is the hardware capacity required to deploy ```F```, ```IoTReqs``` is the list of the IoT devices required by ```F```, and ```SecReqs``` are the security policies for ```F```. 
A security policy is either a list or an AND/OR composition of security properties.

Requirements on network bandwidth can be specified by declaring (directed) flows among pairs of service functions (```F1```, ```F2```) and the ```Bandwidth``` (in Mbps) they need to communicate properly:

```prolog
flow(F1, F2, Bandwidth).
```

Finally, constraints on maximum tolerated latency for (directed) service paths crossing the functions ```F1 ->  F2 -> ... -> FN``` can be specified as

```prolog
maxLatency([F1, F2, ...,FN], MaxLatency).
```

As an example, an instance of the chain below, which insists on a single CCTV system (```video1```) and on a single alarm system (```alarm1```), can be declared as in [chain.pl](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/EdgeUsher/blob/master/chains/chain.pl).

#### Infrastructures

EdgeUsher permits to easily specify an infrastructure and its probabilistic dynamics. An infrastructure is modelled as a graph composed by nodes and links. A (Cloud or Edge) node identified by a certain ```NodeId``` can be declared as

```prolog
node(NodeId, HWCaps, IoTCaps, SecCaps).
```

where ```HWCaps``` is the available hardware capacity of that node, ```IoTCaps``` is the list of  IoT devices that the node reaches out directly, and ```SecProps``` is the list of the security capabilities it features. 

On the other hand, a (point-to-point or end-to-end) link connecting ```NodeA``` to ```NodeB``` which is available in the considered infrastructure can be declared as

```prolog
link(NodeA, NodeB, Latency, Bandwidth).
```

where ```Latency``` is the latency experienced over the link (in ms) and ```Bandwidth``` is the transmission capacity it offers (in Mbps). 

EdgeUsher also permits to naturally specify probabilistic profiles of both nodes and links by exploiting ProbLog _annotated disjunctions_. 

As an example, a portion of the UC Davis edge infrastructure, inspired from [(Ning et al., 2019)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8594705), can be declared as in [complete.pl](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/EdgeUsher/blob/master/infra/complete.pl).

### Usage

There exist two versions of EdgeUsher:

- [edgeusher.pl](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/EdgeUsher/blob/master/edgeusher.pl), which performs an exhaustive search for all eligible placemnents of a VNF chain to an Edge/Cloud infrastructure,
- [hedgeusher.pl](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/EdgeUsher/blob/master/hedgeusher.pl), which prunes the search space through heuristics and only returns a subset of the optimal solutions.

After downloading the repo, one should create the a ```main.pl``` file in the root folder and consult the EdgeUsher version of choice as in:

```prolog
:- consult('edgeusher'). % exhaustive search
:- consult('hedgeusher'). % heuristic search
```

After specifying an input chain and an Edge infrastructure, EdgeUsher can be used to determine all eligible service function placements and flow routings by simply issuing the query:

```prolog
query(placement(Chain, Placement, Routes)).
```

Output results will be of the form: 

```prolog
placement(chainId,
  [on(f1,n1), on(f2,n2), ..., on(fk,nk)],
  [(n1, n2, usedBw, [(f1, f2), ...]), ...]).
```

where the ```on(.,.)``` constructor associates a service function to its deployment node, whilst each ```(n1, n2, usedBw, [(f1, f2), ...])``` keeps track on the bandwidth consumption and of all the service-to-service flows mapped onto the link between nodes ```n1``` and ```n2```.

It is worth noting that EdgeUsher allows users to easily specify function _affinity_ or _anti-affinity_ requirements among service functions. In the first case, the user can force the mapping of two (or more) functions to the same node, as for instance in the query

```prolog
query(placement(Chain, [on(F1,N1), on(F2,N2), on(F3,N2)], Routes)).
```

stating that ```F2``` and ```F3``` must be mapped on a same node ```N2```.

Analogously, anti-affinity constraints can be specified by queries of the form:

```prolog
query(placement(Chain, 
      [on(F1,N1), on(F2,N2), on(F3,N3)], Routes),
      N2 \== N3).
```
stating that ```F2``` and ```F2``` must be mapped on two different nodes ```N2``` and ```N3```.

Additionally, users can specify partial deployments and/or routes, and use \prototype to complete them. This is useful to quickly determine on-demand re-configurations of a chain in case of infrastructure failures or malfunctioning (e.g., crash of a node currently supporting a function service). Also, users can run EdgeUsher over complete deployments and/or routes -- e.g. among those already enacted or obtained via other tools -- so to instantaneously assess them against varying infrastructure conditions. 

All the described functionalities work also with the heuristic version of the prototype, which can be queried as

```prolog
query(placement(Chain, Placement, Routes, ThrHW, ThrQoS)).
```

by specifying two threshold values, ```ThrHW``` and ```ThrQoS```, that are used to cut the search space whenever the probability of satisfying the chain hardware or QoS requirements, respectively, falls below them.
